        <h3>
          Yet another disclaimer. I could talk about this subject for hours.
          I've seen this movie 25 times. There is so much more I could add.
          Things have also been purposefully left out due to being to violent
          (?)

          Stephen King is a man I wish I could personally beat with a comically
          large mallet, But it must be admitted that his works have had great
          influence over horror. If you couldn't tell by the red bathroom
          previously shown, Emesis Blue references
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shining_(film)"
            target="_blank"
            >The Shining</a
          >
          quite a bit.

        <p>The bar scene. Now with a fellow named Dell rather than Lloyd.</p>

          <p>
          Another work of King's, <i>The Jaunt</i> is also heavily referenced.
        </p>
        <h2>
          <i
            >"The story takes place early in the 24th century, when the
            technology for teleportation, referred to as "Jaunting", is
            commonplace, allowing for nearly instantaneous transportation across
            enormous distances, even to other planets in the Solar System. But
            the process is very specific, and has dire consequences if it goes
            wrong."</i
          >
        </h2>
        
        <p>
          In The Jaunt, when Jaunting doesn't work properly, travellers are
          stuck for what feels like eternity. Emerging mad after endless time in
          a white void. Claiming it's "Longer than you think." Emesis Blue
          revolves around The Respawn Machine, a complicated piece of technology
          that can bring the dead back to life. Good as new. But if it was
          working, the movie's events simply wouldn't have happened, It's
          malfunctioning. They're coming back wrong.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>Fritz Ludwig, a medic, has seen this process's faults first hand.</p>
        <p>
          Fritz's character and namesake comes from Fritz Lang's
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M_(1931_film)" target="_blank"
            >M</a
          >, which also lends its'
          <i>In The Hall Of The Mountain King</i> motif. The movie is even seen
          and heard in Emesis Blue, both on TV and a tape.

          There's so much to this movie. I only started understading the plot on
          my 6th rewatch. Figured mostly everything out at 21.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's a good movie, maybe not always in writing, or in voice acting,
          but it is such good quality.
