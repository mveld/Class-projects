    <h1>TEAM FORTRESS 2 MY BELOVED</h1>
    <h2>A GAME THAT JUST WON'T DIE</h2>

    <hr />
    <h3>
      Team Fortress 2 (TF2) is a 2007 multiplayer first-person shooter game
      developed and published by Valve Corporation &#169;. It is the sequel to
      the 1996 Team Fortress mod for
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(video_game)" target="_blank"
        >Quake</a
      >
      and its 1999 remake, Team Fortress Classic.
    </h3>

    <p>In the mid to late summer of 2024, I started playing TF2.</p>
    <p>
      It was an immediate hook, spectactular gameplay, the sharp art style,
      vibrant colors, entertaining characters, and absurd world building felt
      like it was almost tailored to me specifically.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's no wonder this game was popular for a while, competing with the likes
      of Blizzard's
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overwatch" target="_blank"
        ><i>Overwatch</i></a
      >
      (I say compete, as it's surpassed it on several occasions.)
    </p>
    <p>
      But the thing that has carried it (and I) this far, all these years later,
      is the absolutely unhinged and scarily creative community that has grown
      around it. Like mold to bread, except if that mold gave the bread arms and
      legs and sentience. And eternal life, apparently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The TF2 community is responsible for many additions to the game, bug
      fixes, maps, cosmetics and emotes. (but we just call them <i>taunts.</i>)
      The community is also responsible for a plethora of fan creations. The
      ever popular, and important addition to online meme culture,
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV3fNs53o4k" target="_blank">
        <i>The Heavy Is Dead</i></a
      >
      is what I would say, a staple in surreal fast paced humor, using spliced
      voicelines from the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      There of course, is the other side of the spectrum, the fully voiced,
      feature length and quality, psychological horror film
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0ODG8bFme0" target="_blank">
        <i> Emesis Blue.</i></a
      >
      I have seen this movie, running at an hour and 48 minutes long, 25 times.
      <i>I do not play about Emesis Blue.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Given it's importance in online culture, and the inescapable inclusion of
      the internet in modern life, TF2 was actually present and influencing my
      life before I even played. It was everywhere, even qouting it when I had
      no idea i was.

      TF2 also contains a multiplayer gamemode, where you, and up to 6 other
      players fight against hoards of robots with your likeness. A personal
      favorite of mine, this gamemode, <i>MANN VS MACHINE</i>, has led to quite
      a few online friendships.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mann VS Machine also works as a fun narrative to current day ethic
      crisises with AI. Destroying hoards of robots with your likeness trying to
      replace you because they're cheaper to pay than you? Absolutely wonderful.
      I want more.
