      <h1>EMESIS BLUE</h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Emesis Blue is a fan-made, feature-length, psyhcological horror film,
        containing many references to other media, new and old alike. Using
        characters, assets, and lore from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Fortress_2" target="_blank">Team Fortress 2</a>, it is widely
        considered a VASTLY impressive feat of online fanwork.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was animated entirely in Source Film Maker, VALVE'S own animation
        software made for their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_(game_engine)" target="_blank">game engine.</a> SFM is known to be buggy, but very
        useful. A wonderful piece of software, albiet outdated. To make
        something running at 2 hours and 48 minutes long in such a progam, with
        such high quality, seems alien to me.
      </p>
      <p> Other games made in the Source engine: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Half life 2</li>
        <li> DOTA 2</li>
        <li> Counter Strike: Global Offensive </li>
        <li> Portal 1 & 2 </li>
        <li> Left 4 Dead 1 & 2</li>
      </ul>

        Not only is it known for its's impressiveness, but the actual narrative
        has value as well. It's vague, but in your face. The horror can be
        subtle. Implications carry the film's actual content much further than
        initially stated. I've seen endless debating in forums, and analysis
        videos longer than the movie itself.

          Starting with a doctor's appointment, and ending somewhere between a
          trip to the underworld and a bar in limbo. It's an insane movie, but
          the cherry on top is the true intentions of its' creation.
